Imagine you are a box much like this one:

Let's draw a free-body diagram of the box A.K.A. you. In physics, a free-body diagram represents all the forces on an object. For example, you have the force of gravity(W) acting on you.

Gravity is the lone force and therefore has the only influence on how you moves. It's only logical that you'd move down. With economics, it's quite the same: incentives move people. Let us transpose the free-body diagram into something more like you (assuming that you're a human):

There're definitely motivations in your life, right? Maybe they include raising self-sufficient children, or achieving a 4.0 GPA, or becoming famous for being the first person to lick his or her elbow. These are all forces or <i>incentives</i> that drive our actions:

Of course, since these "forces" are tied in what we as humans live for, they are an integral part of understanding the economy. As we seek to maximize our utility, any chance for doing so becomes an incentive to us. Cutting income taxes for workers provides the incentive to work and earn more. "Happy Hour" prices at the local bar provides the incentive to drink and spend more (thus benefiting the firm and not your liver).

Incentives can be sneaky. It's easy to have counterintuitive consequences/incentives pop up when you're trying to do something. If I decided that in order to make friends I'd give them all $100 to seal our friendship, I'm sure many of those "friends" would turn out to be phonies hoping to make a quick buck. Ok, that one was obvious. How about American doctors being paid on a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/11/the-real-reason-health-care-is-bankrupting-america.html">fee-per-service basis</a> for healthcare? That seems fair--each service they perform is compensated for--until some smart doctor figures out that he or she can just charge unnecessary extra fees to generate a higher payday. And the patient doesn't know as much as the doctor, so the doctor has a low-risk and profitable incentive to practice such a con. Problems with misaligned incentives should be heavily considered in determining public policy, or else something unintended might make matters worse.

Playing with incentives is like the strings on a puppet. If they're pulled just the right way, policymakers can manipulate people based on their desires. It's like Newton's First Law: otherwise inert objects will stay inert unless some strong force compels them to move.

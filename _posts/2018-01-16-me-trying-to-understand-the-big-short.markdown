During a Christmas party, some friends and I decided to watch <i>The Big Short</i>. The financial side of it didn't make that much sense, but what mattered was that the "good" guys won by reaping millions of dollars from the stupid banks, right? Ok, maybe it was just another amoral transaction that involved risk and reward. But it was fun to watch.

After reading <i>Naked Economics</i> by Charles Wheelan, however, I now have better insight into the horrible series of events that led to the Great Recession (and how some guys royally screwed investment bankers). Let's start with the subprime mortgages. Normal people wanted to buy and flip houses with the rising housing market, so they got loans from the banks. These people may not have had the best credit, but the banks didn't care; they had an incentive not to. Right after, the lenders could just "sell" their borrower's debt to investment banks in supposedly-secure bundles. See where this is going? If the housing market crashed, then all of the Wall Street investment banks would lose their capital. People didn't see it because it hadn't yet; all they saw were exponential growth in housing prices.

Enter the heroes of the movie. First, Christian Bale A.K.A. Michael Burry. He's awkward, he has a glass eye, and he figures out that there is a housing bubble just by looking at mortgage payments on a screen (according to the movie). He sees them slowing down, and figuring it bound to bust, goes around to the big investment banks and buys credit default swaps. These swaps are one of key elements on why he made money. Credit default swaps are a financial tool that basically function as debt insurance. For example, if you reluctantly made a loan to your flippant vegan friend trying to create edible grass (to avoid hurting her feelings), you could secretly go to a third party and buy a credit default swap. You'd pay a fee to the third party for the time being, but if your vegan friend can't make edible grass (darn cellulose) and loses your money, the third party would compensate you in full. Now transpose this onto Wall Street: Michael Burry buying their swaps is essentially saying that he'll pay them money to insure the housing market's loans for now, but when it all comes crashing down they'll have to pay him back handsomely. Naturally, since nobody at the banks thought there was anything wrong with the housing market, banks unloaded swaps like a waterfall. The other protagonists of the movie followed Burry's actions suit.

As a side note, I'd like to comment on how colorful the other protagonists' means of confirming a housing bubble were. This included driving to Florida, scouting empty houses, and even talking to a stripper with five houses.

Then everything came crashing down (for the banks). Banks like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns thought that their bundles of mortgages were secure because of (incompetent) credit rating agencies and how everyone shouldn't fall behind on their payments--but that's pretty much what happened. The bubble burst because in actuality there were little physical assets compared to the bubble, so from there everything went down in the pits (of Brad Pitt and the other people who bet against the housing market). This is where our protagonists got their big payday--at the expense of Wall Street. America's economy promptly went into recession.

And that's the story of America was swindled in <i>The Big Short</i>.

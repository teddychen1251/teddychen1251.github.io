I think we all learned this from watching TV sitcoms: if you find someone through a dating website, chances are that person is only one wooden birdhouse away from being a cuckoo clock. But why? Theoretically, a community as diverse as the Internet would surely be able to reach many normal (as deemed by society) single people, one of whom just might be "the one". To illustrate why this is not the case, I feel that it'd be gratifying to literally illustrate it with two scenarios:

Scenario A: "Normal" person

<img src="/assets/sadGuyMeets.png" alt="Guy meets girl" style="display:block;margin:auto;" text-align="center">
<img src="/assets/love.png" alt="Love" style="display:block;margin:auto;" text-align="center">

Scenario B: "Unconventional" person

This is a classic example of "adverse selection" in economics. Basically, people who would stand to benefit more from a program will take advantage of it than people who wouldn't. In this case, the "normal" guy was doing well with the ladies in real life, so he had no need for a website. Sadly, this wasn't so with the crazy guy!

Adverse selection is a serious consideration for firms trying to make money. Take insurance, for example: a company charging a straight $1000 per year for car insurance anywhere in Illinois is a very bad marketing strategy. The firm may have the misconception that a simple "average" premium will allow for a balance between high-risk and low-risk drivers. What'll most likely end up happening is that jovial Chicagoans, excited at the prospect of saving an annual $700, will sign up while people in Normal, Illinois would keep their normal (pun intended) <a href="https://www.carinsurance.com/state/Illinois-car-insurance.aspx">rates at around $800.</a> This way, the company will only incentivize to high-risk people purchase a plan and lose a lot of money.

Dealing with adverse selection is part of the broader subject of information economics. It analyzes how an imbalance in information between parties in a transaction can lead to unwanted consequences (in the above case, Chicago drivers knew they were higher risk and went to the flat rate insurance company). Therefore, knowledge becomes power that translates into money.

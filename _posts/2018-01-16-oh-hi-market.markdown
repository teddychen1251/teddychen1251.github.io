<b>Market:</b> Au contraire.
Seeing as how you are a fundamental human, you seek to maximize your utility (satisfaction or happiness) and make yourself as well off as possible. Therefore, every decision you make is unconsciously economical: finding friends, choosing your outfit, and finishing a summer assignment. Which option is best suited to your skills? Do those blue suede shoes draw away from your otherwise dull personality? Will becoming best friends with that man lead to him having an affair with your fianc√©e later on? Considerations such as these are common to life, and common within me, the market. Consumers weigh their choices, such as investing in stocks or bonds, and deem the one that fits them the most.

But that's not all there is to a market economy. Where do consumers get their goods? Firms. They range from that cute kid down the block selling lemonade to Amazon.com. Like consumers, firms aim to maximize their profits, whether by cutting production costs (that lemonade looks awfully watered down) or inventing new products (HELLO, Amazon Echo). Between these two entities in a market economy, their desires for helping themselves is really where the magic of a market economy happens. Here are two ways:

1. Efficiency

Nobody wants to see something good go to waste, which is especially true in the market for both firms and consumers. Let's say that you are a talented screenwriter and you know it. You're not going to squander that gift by writing book reports for $20 an article! You'd rather be making possibly millions selling screenplays and contributing to society what you do best. It's the same with firms and gaining profit. In the market, resources go to where they're best used.   

2. Innovation

It has been said that there "is no ethical consumption under capitalism". Technically, that's true--market transactions don't necessarily involve questions of ethics, but that doesn't mean the market is immoral. Actually, consumers and firms acting in their own interests can improve the well-being of the whole population. Just take a look outside and see companies and teams trying to find ways to make money; as they brainstorm, the inventions that result from their work will eventually make their way to the rest of the people and benefit them. Bitcoin is run on the Blockchain public ledger, which is run by a development team. The motivation for profit drove them to create a secure, decentralized transaction system that makes cryptocurrencies more usable. Whether this specific example helps everyone else can be debated, but the broader point of benevolent innovation is valid.

The market is a force. Not a good force, not a bad force, but an engine that plows toward progress. While some may be left behind, new opportunities fill the vacancies for the common good. That is the idea of creative destruction that happens naturally in a market economy. Since we're all part of it, our choices and preferences that influence our actions influence the way the market goes as well.

You economized it after all.

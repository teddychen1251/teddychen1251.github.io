In my opinion, a board game is a surefire way to have fun with a group of friends. Monopoly is no exception. But if there were one person/entity I'd never play this game with, it's the government. It has already owns monopolies.

<i>"Whaaatttt!!???"</i> you may think, believing that monopolies were outlawed. Well, seeing as how the role of government is usually to ensure public goods like driver's licenses and mail, they kinda have to monopolize the system. Let's go back to the example of driver's licenses. Government definitely should handle the DMV, because letting private competing firms issue driver's licenses is akin to letting students pay teachers for their grades: the firms want to make money, so they have an incentive to license as many drivers as possible. But because government has no competition for granting driving privileges, they can get lazy. Think about it: whether or not they improve the efficiency of DMVs or train clerks more rigorously has no effect on who will still come as a customer. Everyone who wants to drive will have to come to the DMV, no matter how bad it might be. This is the monopoly effect: since there is no threat of competition, the government doesn't care as much to make itself better (in regards to the monopolized matter).

But perhaps there are areas where the government should step back. One example may be <a href="http://time.com/4927852/hurricane-harvey-flood-insurance/">flood insurance</a>. Looking back at Hurricane Harvey, one can be astounded at the figure that four-fifths of its victims were not insured against floods. Part of this was due to the government having a monopoly on flood insurance, the National Flood Insurance Program. People in certain higher-risk areas are required to have it, which did not include much of Houston (most bet on the fact that a storm like Harvey was extremely low-probability), where Harvey struck. But since the government already monopolizes flood insurance, private insurance firms are discouraged from researching it and seeking out new and improved policies, while the government is more lax due to the monopoly effect. If the NFIP were cut back a bit and private firms could compete, there might be a better chance for people to be insured the next time a storm hits.

I suppose the key lies in discerning where the government should keep doing its job and where it should let the market economy step in. That's one of the reasons we study economics.

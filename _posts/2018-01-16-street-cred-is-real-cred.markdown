Economics appreciates both types of intelligence: book smarts and street smarts. We'll be focusing on street smarts in this blog post.

I must admit, due to the sheltered life I've lived I can't say that I'm an expert in "the streets." But I understand human values somewhat, so I know that making a name for yourself makes a pathway for better opportunities. This is because people will know you and therefore respect you. The same thing happens on a larger scale with firms: branding is everything. Take a look at the stores below. Which would you rather go to for a tub of ice cream?

<div style="width:100%;margin-bottom:10px">
<img src="/assets/walmart.jpg" alt="Walmart" style="display:block;width:80%;height:30vh;margin:auto;">

</div>

My guess is that you would choose WalMart. WalMart is everywhere: by your house, on your TV commercials, in your coupons. Meanwhile, I don't think you've ever heard of "Jensen Market". Does it even have ice cream? Even if they have better ice cream than WalMart, who knows? To a consumer who doesn't have the time to appraise the products in a general store, WalMart's familiarity is half of its appeal. A well-known name brand can rake in tons of revenue just because it is itself.

This is classic information economics working at its finest. A consumer is faced with the decision to either take a risk with something unknown, or settle for something he <i>knows</i> will have what he's searching for. Unless the consumer is an adventurous type or really has invested himself in choosing a quality product, he will probably go with the predictable option and move on with life.

Companies will do whatever they can to enhance their street cred(ibility). Maybe they'll create a catchy slogan ("Just do it" by Nike), adopt an iconic mascot (the Geico gecko), or pay celebrities to promote their brand ([insert many TV commercials here]). Conversely, they want to avoid anything that'll damage their reputations. Take the very recent example of Tide Pods. Young people have been ingesting them as a "challenge," and it has garnered much attention as a meme.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What should Tide PODs be used for? DOING LAUNDRY. Nothing else.<br><br>Eating a Tide POD is a BAD IDEA, and we asked our friend <a href="https://twitter.com/RobGronkowski?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@robgronkowski</a> to help explain. <a href="https://t.co/0JnFdhnsWZ">pic.twitter.com/0JnFdhnsWZ</a></p>&mdash; Tide (@tide) <a href="https://twitter.com/tide/status/951940660499755008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2018</a></blockquote>

Apart from actually caring for the welfare of teenagers, Tide probably doesn't want all this negative attention directed towards them. So, they implement damage control by making public announcements and even use a celebrity, Rob Gronkowski, to help them.

How you're known is important. It can be the difference when someone is choosing to buy from you or another firm. As in the words of Pubilius Syrus, "A good reputation is more valuable than money."
